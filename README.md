# Shippage

**The landing page skill that writes your sales copy.**

One sentence in your terminal. A deployed page that actually sells. Free forever.

```
"Build a landing page for Deploybot — one-click deploys for small engineering teams"
```

That single prompt produces a complete, conversion-optimized landing page with professional copy, real design tokens, legal pages, cookie consent, SEO schemas, exit-intent popups, and analytics wiring. Not a template. Not a starting point. A production page ready to ship.

Works with Next.js, Vite + React, Remix, Astro, Vue/Nuxt, and Svelte/SvelteKit.

<br>

## The Problem

Ask any AI to build a landing page and you get the same thing every time. Inter font. Purple gradient. A headline that says "Unlock Your Potential" or "Leverage Seamless Solutions." Cards in a grid. No copy strategy, no conversion structure, no personality. We call it **AI slop** and it kills trust on contact.

The page looks like it was made by a robot because it was. Visitors bounce in 3 seconds because nothing on the page speaks to their actual problem.

<br>

## What This Skill Does Differently

**It writes your copy.** Not placeholder text. Not "lorem ipsum." Not "Your compelling headline here." Real conversion copy using 629 lines of tested formulas, calibrated to your product's awareness level, CTA goal, and audience. Every headline is benefit-focused. Every CTA uses outcome language. An anti-AI word filter blocks 40+ overused words so your page sounds human.

**It knows what good design looks like.** Shippage ships with real design tokens extracted from 200+ successful SaaS sites (Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, and 196 more). When you say "dark premium," you don't get a guess. You get a curated palette based on what actually works in the wild.

**It understands conversion science.** Every page follows a 7-step narrative arc where each section has exactly one job: stop the scroll, build trust, agitate the pain, show the solution, prove it works, remove doubt, make the ask. This is the same sequence that A/B tested pages use. Sections are selected and ordered automatically based on your product.

**It handles the stuff nobody wants to build.** Cookie consent banners that comply with GDPR, CCPA, and CNIL standards. Exit-intent popups with A/B testing and frequency capping. Sticky CTA bars. Privacy policies, terms of service, cookie policies, and acceptable use policies generated from your intake data. JSON-LD structured data for Google rich results. OG image templates for social sharing. Sitemap and robots.txt. Analytics wiring with scroll depth tracking and CTA click events.

**It works when you have nothing.** Pre-launch mode handles the cold start problem. No screenshots? Gradient placeholders and architecture diagrams. No testimonials? Founder story sections and traction signals. No logo bar? Waitlist counters, GitHub stars, and beta badges. 60%+ of our users are pre-launch founders. The skill is built for that.

<br>

## Install

```bash
# Copy into your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r shippage ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or clone this repo and symlink it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imjahanzaib/shippage.git
ln -s $(pwd)/shippage ~/.claude/skills/shippage
```

The skill activates automatically whenever you ask Claude Code to build a landing page, marketing page, website, or sales page for any SaaS product. You can also trigger it manually with `/shippage`.

<br>

## Usage

### Quick Mode (one sentence, full page)

Give it a product name and a one-liner. Shippage infers everything else: design system, awareness level, CTA type, vibe, section selection, copy, effects, and mobile optimization.

```
Build a landing page for Calmly — meditation and breathing exercises for anxious developers
```

```
Build me a website for InvoiceBot — AI-powered invoice processing for small accounting firms
```

```
Ship a landing page for GitGuard — automated security scanning for GitHub repos
```

### Guided Mode (full control)

Want more control? The engine walks you through 8 intake questions: product name, one-liner, target audience, awareness level, CTA goal, social proof assets, vibe preference, and brand assets (colors, fonts, logos).

```
Build a landing page for my SaaS (guided mode)
```

### Framework Selection

The default output is React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui. Tell it what you're using and the output adapts:

```
Build a landing page for Deploybot using Astro
Build a landing page for Deploybot using Vue + Nuxt
Build a landing page for Deploybot using SvelteKit
```

### Audit Mode

Already have a landing page? Shippage audits it against the same conversion, design, and performance rules it uses to generate pages.

```
Roast this landing page: https://myproduct.com
Audit my landing page for conversion issues
```

<br>

## What's Inside

### 17 Section Templates

Every section is a complete, documented component with desktop layout, mobile layout, copy rules, accessibility requirements, animation specs, and production-ready JSX.

| Section | Conversion Job |
|---------|---------------|
| **Navbar** | Navigation with CTA that converts on first scroll |
| **Hero (Centered)** | Stop the scroll in 5 seconds with one bold claim |
| **Hero (Split)** | Stop the scroll with screenshot/demo on one side, copy on the other |
| **Social Proof Bar** | Build instant credibility with logos, metrics, or traction signals |
| **Pain Points** | Make the visitor feel understood before showing the solution |
| **Features (Alternating)** | Show how the product solves each pain point, one by one |
| **Features (Bento Grid)** | Show many capabilities at once for product-aware audiences |
| **How It Works** | Reduce perceived complexity to three simple steps |
| **Testimonials** | Let customers prove the claims you just made |
| **Comparison Table** | Win the "why not the competitor?" conversation |
| **Pricing** | Remove the biggest remaining objection: cost |
| **FAQ** | Kill the final doubts before the ask |
| **CTA Footer** | Make the ask. One last time. Clear and direct. |
| **Waitlist** | Viral waitlist with referral links, queue positions, and tiered rewards |
| **Exit-Intent Popup** | Recover abandoning visitors with A/B tested offers |
| **Sticky CTA Bar** | Keep the conversion action visible as the hero scrolls away |
| **Cookie Consent** | GDPR/CCPA compliant banner with preference center and consent proof |

### The Copy Engine (629 lines)

Not a prompt template. A structured copy system with:

| Rule Category | What It Does |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Anti-AI Filter** | Blocks "leverage," "seamless," "cutting-edge," "unlock," and 36 more dead words |
| **Headline Formulas** | 8 tested patterns calibrated by awareness level |
| **CTA Language** | Outcome verbs ("Start shipping faster") over feature verbs ("Sign up") |
| **Social Proof Copy** | Specific numbers ("2,847 teams") over vague claims ("thousands of users") |
| **FAQ Generation** | Answers real objections, not softballs |
| **Voice Calibration** | Matches tone to audience (developer != enterprise buyer != creative) |

### Design Token Database (200+ Sites)

Real design tokens extracted from production SaaS sites using [Dembrandt](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/dembrandt). Not guesses. Not AI-generated palettes. The actual colors, fonts, spacing, and border radii that Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Supabase, Resend, and 194 other successful products use.

Five vibe presets match tokens to your product:

| Vibe | Palette | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Minimal Clean** | Light background, muted accent, generous whitespace | Fintech, B2B, Enterprise |
| **Bold Modern** | Vibrant accent, high contrast, energetic | SaaS, Startups, Marketing tools |
| **Dark Premium** | Dark background, glow accent, polished | Dev tools, AI products, Infrastructure |
| **Playful Creative** | Colorful, warm, rounded | Consumer apps, Design tools, Education |
| **Enterprise Trust** | Navy/gray, conservative, serious | Security, Compliance, Healthcare |

Or skip presets entirely: say **"make it look like linear.app"** and the engine extracts tokens from the live site.

### Effects Budget System

Maximum 3 premium effects per page. No more. This is enforced.

1. ONE hero background effect (Aurora, Particles, Dot Pattern, Beams, Lamp, etc.)
2. ONE headline text effect (Animated Gradient Text, Typewriter, Text Generate, etc.)
3. ONE CTA/section effect (Shimmer Button, Marquee, Moving Border, Number Ticker, etc.)

Scroll reveals, hover states, and stagger animations are always included and do not count toward the budget. CSS fallbacks are defined for every premium effect so the page degrades gracefully if a dependency fails to install.

### Conversion Tools (replaces $600+/year in SaaS subscriptions)

| Tool | Replaces | Savings |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Viral Waitlist** | GetWaitlist, Viral Loops, Prefinery | $15 to $69/mo |
| **Exit-Intent Popup** | OptinMonster, Sumo, Sleeknote | $7 to $299/mo |
| **Sticky CTA Bar** | Hello Bar, OptinMonster | $39 to $129/mo |
| **Cookie Consent** | Termly, Iubenda, CookieYes | $3 to $35/mo |
| **Legal Pages** | Termly, GetTerms, Iubenda | $3 to $35/mo |

### Legal Page Generator

Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy generated from your intake data. Jurisdiction-specific compliance for GDPR (EU), CCPA/CPRA (California), PIPEDA (Canada), and LGPD (Brazil). The footer already links to `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`. This step creates the actual pages.

### SEO Assets

JSON-LD structured data (Organization, SoftwareApplication, FAQPage schemas) for Google rich results. FAQPage schema alone increases SERP real estate by 2 to 3x. Dynamic OG image templates for social shares. Sitemap.xml and robots.txt generated per framework conventions. All with XSS prevention via the `safeJsonLd()` helper.

### Automated QA

Every generated page runs through automated checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/qa-check.py --dir path/to/project
```

Checks mobile responsiveness, load performance (sub-2.5s LCP target), conversion pattern compliance, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), SEO fundamentals, effects budget compliance, and security headers.

<br>

## The 9-Step Process

Nothing is skipped. Nothing is optional. Every page goes through this sequence:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Intake** | Quick mode (product name + one-liner) or guided mode (8 structured questions) |
| **2. Design System** | Match design tokens from the 200+ site database, or extract live from any URL |
| **3. Section Selection** | Pick 6 to 9 sections based on awareness level, CTA goal, and social proof availability |
| **4. Copy Generation** | Write every headline, subheadline, CTA, feature description, and FAQ answer |
| **5. Effects Selection** | Choose up to 3 premium effects within the budget, matched to vibe |
| **6. Assembly** | Build the full project structure adapted to your framework |
| **7. Legal Pages** | Generate privacy policy, terms, cookie policy with jurisdiction-specific compliance |
| **8. SEO Assets** | Add JSON-LD schemas, OG image template, sitemap, robots.txt |
| **9. QA Pass** | Run automated checks for mobile, performance, conversion, accessibility, and SEO |

<br>

## Who This Is For

**You can code but you can't write copy.** You've been staring at a blank hero section for three days. You know React and Tailwind inside out, but you cannot write a headline that makes someone want to sign up. The page looks fine. It just doesn't convert.

**You're pre-launch with nothing to show.** No screenshots. No testimonials. No logo bar. No metrics. Every landing page template assumes you have social proof. You don't. You need a page that sells without it.

**You're already in your terminal.** You use Claude Code for product development. Switching to Framer, Webflow, or v0 to build a landing page is a context switch that costs you hours. You want to stay where you are and get a deployable page without opening another tab.

**You don't want another subscription.** v0 is $20/mo. Framer is $10 to $100/mo per site. OptinMonster is $7 to $82/mo. Termly is $10 to $20/mo. This skill is free, generates code you own, and doesn't burn credits when something goes wrong.

<br>

| **Design token database** | 200+ real SaaS sites | Same output every time | One template | Template gallery |
| **Exit-intent + popups** | Built in, A/B tested | No | No | No |
| **Legal pages** | GDPR/CCPA compliant generators | No | No | No |
| **Cookie consent** | Full CMP with consent proof | No | No | No |
| **SEO automation** | JSON-LD + OG image + sitemap | Basic meta only | Basic meta only | Limited |
| **Frameworks** | 6 frameworks | Next.js only | Next.js only | N/A (proprietary) |
| **Price** | **Free** | $20/mo | $199 one-time | $10 to $100/mo per site |
| **You own the code** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Terminal native** | Yes | No (browser) | No (repo clone) | No (browser) |
